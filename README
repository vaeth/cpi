A POSIX shell wrapper for "cp -i -a", making use of "diff".

For installation just copy "cpi" into your path.

This is a somewhat verbose frontend for cp -i -a:
For each file you see the differences before you confirm/reject the copying.
If the destination file already exists, owner and mode are not preserved
(except in recursive cases); matching files are not copied at all.
This script requires that your "cp" command supports the options
-a -i -d --preserve=timestamps

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).
