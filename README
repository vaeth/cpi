A POSIX shell wrapper for "cp -i -a", making use of "diff".

This is a somewhat verbose frontend for cp -i -a:
For each file you see the differences before you confirm/reject the copying.

You get more detailed instructions by calling
	cpi -h

This script requires that your "cp" command supports the non-POSIX options
-a -d --preserve=timestamps

For installation just copy "cpi" with read+exec permissions into your path.
To obtain support for zsh completion, copy _cpi to a directory of zsh's $fpath.

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).
